A Greedy Algorithm decides what to do in each step,only based on the current situation,
without the thought of how the total problem looks like.
In other words, a greedy algorithm make the locally optimal choice the each step, 
hoping to find the global optimam solution in the end.

Greedy is an algorithm paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always the 
choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy 
algorithms are used for optimization problems. 
At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal 
solution to the complete problem.


Two Properties must be the true for the problem for the greedy algorithm to work

1.Greedy choice property:Means that the problem is so that the solution (the global 
optimum) can be reached by making greedy choices in each step (locally optimal choices).

2.optimal substructure:Means that the optimal solution of the problem, is a collection
of the optimal solutions to sub-problem. so solving smaller parts the problem locally
(by making greedy choice) contributes to the overall solution.
