They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information. 

3 way take the string in the input
  1.cin
  2.getline
  3.stringstream


function of string:

length() : This function return the length of string

size(): This function used the find the size of string
resize(): This funtion used to resize the length of the string up to the given number of characters
push_back(): This function is used to push the passed characters at the end of string
pop_back(): This function is used the pop the last element at the string
