1. simple queue: Simple Queue simply follows FIFO Structure. We can only insert 
                 the element at the back and remove the element from the front of 
                 the queue.

2. Double end queue: In a double-ended queue the insertion and deletion operations,
                     both can be performed from both ends. 

                     1.Input Restricted Queue: This is a simple queue. In this type 
                     of queue, the input can be taken from only one end but deletion 
                     can be done from any of the ends.

                     2.Output Restricted Queue:This is also a simple queue. In this type 
                     of queue, the input can be taken from both ends but deletion can be 
                     done from only one end.

3. Circular queue:  This is a special type of queue where the last position is connected 
                    back to the first position. Here also the operations are performed 
                    in FIFO order.

4.  Priority queue: A priority queue is a special queue where the elements are accessed 
                    based on the priority assigned to them. 

                    1.Ascending Priority Queue:In Ascending Priority Queue, the elements 
                    are arranged in increasing order of their priority values. Element 
                    with smallest priority value is popped first.

                    2.Descending Priority Queue: In Descending Priority Queue, the 
                    elements are arranged in decreasing order of their priority values. 
                    Element with largest priority is popped first.
